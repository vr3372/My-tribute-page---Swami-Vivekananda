        <h1>Swami Vivekananda</h1>

          <p>
            Swami Vivekananda , born Narendranath Datta , was an Indian Hindu
            monk.He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian
            philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world
          </p>
          <p>
            He is perhaps best known for his speech which began with the words -
            <strong>"Sisters and brothers of America ...,"</strong> in which he
            introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in
            Chicago in 1893.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by
            his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings
            were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God
            could be rendered by service to humankind.
